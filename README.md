Description of the Task 2: Grade Calculator

This project was developed as Task 2 during my internship at CodSoft from 10 January 2026 to 10 February 2026.

The objective of this task was to build a console-based Java application that calculates a student’s overall performance by taking subject marks as input. The program computes total marks, average percentage, grade, division, and pass/fail status, along with identifying the highest and lowest marks entered.
